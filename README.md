# Pixy Battle

## PixyBattle: a LaserTag-style Competition Between Autonomous, Machine Vision-Guided Robots in JRC 2017

Welcome to the Pixy Battle!

More information can be found on the [official website](http://womenscodingcircle.com/pixyrace/).

## Initial Setup
If you want to return your PixyBot to its default settings, use one of the following methods:

### Method #1: PiBakery

The easiest way to reset your PixyBot is to use the PiBakery recipe provided under the ```recipes``` directory.

Download and run [PiBakery](http://www.pibakery.org/) and import the appropriate recipe. You can customize the Wifi settings as well. 

Insert your PixyBot's SD card into your SD card writer and click "Write". 

Once the card is written, you can insert it back into the PixyBot and boot it up. The install can take up to an hour to download and install all the necessary libraries. If it is interrupted before completion, you'll need to either complete the install yourself using the manual steps below, or flash the SD card and start over again.

### Method #2: Manual Install

With this method, you will perform the installation steps manually. This has the benefit of being able to check at each step to make sure everything has gone smoothly.

#### Download NOOBS and flash the SD card
Start by [downloading the NOOBS image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) and copying it to the SD card. TO format the SD card, you can use utilities built into your operating system, or download a tool like [SD Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/). 

#### Boot
Once the SD card is ready, insert it into the Raspberry Pi, and connect an HDMI cable, a keyboard, and a laptop. Then connect a power cable to boot the Pi. The adapter should be capable of at least 2A @ 5V.

#### Install dependencies 
Open a terminal window and type the following command to download and install the necessary system packages:
```
$ sudo apt-get install git libusb-1.0-0-dev \
qt4-dev-tools g++ libboost-all-dev cmake swig
```

#### Clone this git repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/WomensCodingCircle/pixybattle.git
```

#### Run the installer
This will download and build all the required libraries, and install them in the appropriate locations.
```
$ cd pixybattle
$ ./install.sh
```

#### Customize Keyboard layout

By default, the Raspberry Pi is configured with a UK keyboard. The install script above sets the layout to US. To change the keyboard configuration, run the configuration command:
```
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

## Using SSH
We recommend enabling SSH, so that you can connect to the Pi remotely:
1. Enter `sudo raspi-config` in a terminal window
2. Select **Interfacing Options**
3. Navigate to and select **SSH**
4. Choose **Yes**
5. Select **Ok**
6. Choose **Finish**

If you have a Macbook, you can now connect directly to the Pi with an ethernet cable, and then run ssh from Terminal:
```
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```
Other operating systems require [some extra effort](https://pihw.wordpress.com/guides/direct-network-connection/).

## Using PixyMon
In order to assign color signatures for the PixyCam to recognize, you must use a utility called **PixyMon**. To run this utility, connect an HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the Raspberry Pi and log into the GUI environment. If you followed all the setup steps above, you should see a shortcut to PixyMon on your desktop. 

## Running the code

Once the initial set up is complete, you should be able to run any of the scripts provided in ```src/python```:

* **racer.py** - this is the basic line-following racer code from 2016's Pixy Race
* **circle.py** - randomly roams about around and pauses for 5 seconds each time it gets hit with an opposing IR gun
* **lasertag.py** - follows Pixy's signature #1 (as set in PixyMon) and tries to fire the IR gun every second

You must run these scripts as root (i.e. using ```sudo```), for example:

```
$ cd ~/pixybattle/src/python
$ sudo python lasertag.py
```
